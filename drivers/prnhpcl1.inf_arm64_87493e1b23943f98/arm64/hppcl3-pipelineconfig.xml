   <!-- Filter service providers are not supported pre-Windows 7.  On Vista, it appears that the
        Pipeline manager will not complete filter initialization if a FilterServiceProvider is
        specified.  In order to make this sample portable, we use the fallback registry lookup
        instead.  If you would like to experiment with the FilterServiceProvider support on 
        Windows 7, uncomment the following line. -->
   <FilterServiceProvider dll="hpbx3w81.dll" />
